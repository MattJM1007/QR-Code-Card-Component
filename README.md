## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was fairly straight forward project. But I am still learning and getting used to HTML and CSS. 
One thing I keep making mistakes on is being sure I am targeting the right elements with my CSS to get it to do what I want to do.
I also learned a little more about targeting the right element with Flexbox to get it to center on the page.

### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable with laying out a web page and content. I still get confused on how exactly to center and align things in an efficient way.

### Useful resources

- [Drop Shadow Resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow) - This helped me figure out how to add the drop shadows correctly.
